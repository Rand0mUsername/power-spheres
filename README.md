# power-spheres
- A simple web game I created while learning WebGL in Petnica Science Center (fall seminar of computing, November 2015)
- My first project in javascript, I also taught myself some basic HTML and CSS in the process in order to make the game complete
- This won't work by default locally, because of cross-domain rules
- You can play the game [here](http://rand0musername.github.io/power-spheres/powerSpheres.html)
